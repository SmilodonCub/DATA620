    "For this assignment we will be visualizing a Star Wars data set. This dataset was generated by Dennis Bakhuis from web scrapings off the Wookieepedia website. [Wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) is the Star Wars wiki page which serves as an online encyclopedia for any and all things about the Star Wars universe. A full description of Dennis's methods are available on [his github](https://github.com/dennisbakhuis/wookieepediascience).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set consists of several components. The main component is a file of Star Warsc characters. Wookieepedia has pages for all things Star Wars: characters, places, flaura & fauna, equipment, events etc. The `StarWars_characters` data set is a filtered subset of just characters (droid inclusive). These characters will be used as nodes to establish a network. However, no network is complete without an edgelist. To build connectivity, we will follow the lead detailed in Dennis Bakhuis' notebooks to build edges from lists of links between character pages. The `lists` list is an attribute that will be pulled from raw data sources and iteratively processed. An edge will be added to the network for every character-to-character page link.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To add a categorical variable to to the character nodes, we would like to establish a label that determines whether a character is 'Good', 'Bad' or 'Neutral'. However, 'Good' or 'Bad' are subjective terms even in the Star Wars universe. Wookieepedia does not provide a label, therefore to establish an unbiased approach, we will turn to the raw data. Wookieepedia character pages provide a 'sidepanel' of summary information. Included in this panel is a listing of 'Affiliations' under the 'Chronological and political information' header. We will use a scoring of the Affiliations to determine whether a character is 'Good', 'Bad' or 'Neutral'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**'High Level' Data Plan:**\n",
    "* Establish Star Wars character network from nodes & edges as described by the dataset author\n",
    "* Build a categorical representation for each character based on affiliations to describe 'Good'|'Bad'|'Neutral' alignment\n",
    "* Visualize the network and render nodes color-coded categorically\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have established classification labels for the characters, we will compare degree centrality across the categorical groups. It will be very interesting to learn if characters aligned with the Jedi/Rebels/Republic ('Good') have a difference connectivity than characters aligned with the Sith/Empire ('Bad'). The following are several centrality measures we are intersted in evaluating for this project: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore/rank high scores for the three types:\n",
    "      `celebrity` - raw # of connections to other characters\n",
    "      `gossip`    - avg distance\n",
    "      `bridges`   - high-volume pass-thru between separated groups\n",
    "2. Transparency - explore if transparency can be modeled\n",
    "   from the ratio of Gossip / Celebrity\n",
    "3. Split-loyalty. I wonder if Anakin's network will show that he is a\n",
    "   Bridge, or closely aligned to the Jedi, because of his close connection\n",
    "   to Palpatine\n",
    "4) Is there a clear case for a Gray Cardinal character?"
